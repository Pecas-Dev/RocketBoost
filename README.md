# RocketBoost

**The Repos in my GitHub page are logs of my progress as a Game Developer.** 

Despite not having created my own game **yet**, I have come a long way since the first time I decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to create videogames. Every journey starts with a first step, and these are my first steps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple game made in Unity3D about a Rocket, it portrays my progress as a GameDev. Uploaded to GitHub Pages.

This project is my own modeified version with added features of the game project/idea made by [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/). 

-**NOTE**:

- Spacebar to use thrusters.
- A and D Keys || Left and Down Arrow Keys to control rotation.

Although most of the features in the game are my idea, as I stated previously, this is a modified version of an original game made by **GameDev.tv**, the key mechanics an game idea are theirs, so I want to give them their credit for that. This game wouldn't have been possible without them, and I want to thank them for leading me in this game development journey. The tutor during this project is [Rick Davidson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsonrick/).

In short, the general concpet of the game is **GameDev.TV's**, and this is my own **modified** version of the game with my own added features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **AS FOR 2021-2023, THE GAMES WITH THIS MESSAGE ARE THE RESULTS OF MY OWN MODIFIED VERSIONS OF GAMEDEV.TV'S ORIGINAL VERSION OF THEIR GAMES.**
